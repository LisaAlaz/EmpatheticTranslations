"I've had a hard time going back to school. Going back to school has been difficult for me, It's been around five years since I've been in a class room and I ask the teachers and the people that I go to my classes to cut me some slack for being rusty but they tell me that it doesn't matter, and my step mom doesn't want me to use the computer because she doesn't want to share. Its lead me to skipping classes because I feel like theirs no use in going to school, it would be cool to know how you would handle this situation and if you can give me any advice.","sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too  ",", but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school.

I miss my mum. I'm just crying a lot today and.I'm really depressed because I miss my mum,"I'm sorry, my friend. I lost my mum too, two years ago. I feel your pain but it'll get better for you, I promise."," I lost my mum too, two years ago.  but it'll get better for you, I promise."
Not going to kill myself but I really want to die. What is the point?? Everything is shit anyway?? I really didn't ask to be born and then my parents put this life responsibility on me. Anybody else feel like this?,"omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that  child labor laws, yo . Lol sorry your post is just so relatable I had to rant.","omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression.

Just cut myself for the first time. I've been drinking and i don't know how I feel,"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down. Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Please let me know if you want to talk. You are a strong person &lt;3","Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what?

I feel so misunderstood. Why nobody seems to understand in pain and what going through? Living is not that easy :  I think I kinda wanna die ...,"Hi friend!   I'm really sorry you're in such pain :  sometimes the people we have around us can't see the pain we're in because they don't want to  they may see it, not know how to help us, and are afraid to because it may cause them pain . This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you.

Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through. Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have.

I feel worthless. My gf cheated on me twice. I feel worthless. It has destroyed my self-esteem.,"Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them. This action means that they are a cheater, not that you are worthless."," Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you.

They call me lazy when I try to take rest in bed . She won't understand no matter how many times I explain it.","I'm so sorry to hear about your situation--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding. I don't think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your pain--even if there is not a reliable treatment now, pain relief is a major area of medical science research.  Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?  You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option. Otherwise, it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity, paid or unpaid, that is meaningful to you  if movement is an issue, look up online opportunities  which will help you get your mind off of your pain.","--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding.

If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail.

They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits.  Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well.

if anti-depressants are so bad then what should one take?. Im passing through a huge crisis right now,"what are you needing help with? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed. There is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds, and monitoring. Lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient, refer a psych and hope for the best.  They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis. Sometimes doctors will prescribe short term assistance like Benzos and tranquilizers to keep stable in the short term, I found this works better for me than long term anti-depressents.","? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed.

How could I be happy if nobody is happy with me?. And why would I want to live on?,"Hi there, you know that is a very good question and I used to have similar thoughts as you. I now have a question to ask you, why would other be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The thing is, we need to develop self love and self care first. Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others. I would recommend you to google how to self love or seek therapy to talk this over and find out what your root cause is. There is always help and a better life when you decide to become better and healthier. I speak from experience.

Cooking/Nutrition for Depression. I'm having trouble keeping up with basic cooking. What are the easiest/healthiest meals I can have to keep my nutrition up? I've been eating so many plain turkey sandwiches.,"Can you just get one of those packages of pre-washed spinach and add those to your sandwiches as a start? Take what you have working for you and try to cram as many nutrients in as possible. Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone  or any other type  soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content.  My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating.  Baby steps, man. Baby steps.","? Take what you have working for you and try to cram as many nutrients in as possible.

Does it help?.

Also, you have to put in the work. Therapy doesn't fix anything. Just helps educate you on how to better handle yourself. Meds also work, but sometimes you have to try a few different kinds to find the best fit for you. They don't work overnight either; they can take upwards of 10-14 days in most cases before your brain starts to readjust.

"Do you think some jobs are really meant for people with mental illnesses?. I mean to say that those jobs are only limited to people with depression, just that a good fit Edit: Jobs like being an artist, working in the film industry, therapists, nurses, etc.","Every job you mentioned will have significant pressure, which can lead to more depression. Artist - a friend of mine is a indie musician type of artist. Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people.

"People with no depression think that time is limitless. After a lot of thinking, I figure that a lot of people who don't suffer depression don't have the sense of time.

Why the fuck do I have to succeed?. Why can't I just be human for once.,"You don't.  All my life I've scorned going to college because it held no value for me. I plan to become a traveling hermit and live in the wild with a tent or tarp. I consider myself a successful human being because I've cultivated my mind. I've figured things out. I've matured enough to manage my own personality  as in, not being one of those if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best people .

Just cut myself for the first time. I've been drinking and i don't know how I feel,"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down.  Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever.

"Post-suicide Questions I Wanted to Ask. I started writing my letters today and I wondered how people would receive them if they were electronic. These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing.  Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral?  I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.","the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it. Please, for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you, think again. There is hope out there, even if everything seems hopeless right now.","the thing, though, your death be feasible.

"Sometimes I wonder if I really even have depression. I was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago by my family doctor, who prescribed SSRIs \ which I never took\ .

I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression.

"Starting new meds and looking at about a month more of hell.. So I was getting ready to switch meds when I had to switch insurance. Old Dr wasn't covered anymore and it has taken almost 4 weeks to find a new one. During this time I got low enough to have a passive attempt at harming/killing myself because I was totally off meds. So today I get into the dr and get prescribed zoloft. Staring at the lowest dose and increasing by 25 MG a week.

Does anyone know how to study when they're depressed?. I can't find the strength to do anything. It's almost as if my mind has turned off.,"That has to be tough.  It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus.  Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!","  It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion.

I.... just always depressed.. I ever think doing the right thing.,Me too..depression clouds our judgment. It gets really hard to think about things clearly. Hate this feeling but it won't go away yet.,.
can’t go to school anymore. i been to college in weeks because i just have no motivation to go. i know i should go but i just care anymore. i care about my future anymore. everything feels so pointless and struggling to find any reason to live,"I remember when I was in a deep stage of depression I always begged my mother to let me stay home. Even when she drove me to school, I would catch a bus to the shops and ditch school.  Never got caught hehe  Anyway, I just felt so.. bored of school and so sick of all the shit that went down there. Instead, I decided to live my life, have fun, sleep, ditch school or do whatever and just live the life as I wanted to. If you cant find motivation in one thing, than find motivation in another.

How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"It's the little things that get me, I suppose. Whether it's a happy evening spent with family or an exciting roadtrip, everything just has something off about it.

How do some people get so lucky?. How do some people get lucky enough they don't get depressed and seem to live active healthy happy lives? It's like a curse of chance your either lucky enough to not have it come down on your or your one of the unfortunate ones to have it happen.,"I think it's a matter of perspective. Bad things happen to everyone, but how you react makes a difference. I don't see the point of complaining. If I'm upset or feel like I've been dealt a bad hand, I look for a solution. In the past, I used to beat myself up over all my screw ups or when I felt I wasn't treated right. I realize now that everyone goes through the same type of things and you can't fight them. Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome. They don't wallow. Having confidence that you will overcome these negative events helps portray the happy personality.","I think it's a matter of perspective.

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years  Im 42 now  the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though.

But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything.

Just remember that no matter how bad life feels  and is...  even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now  suffering from  pain and bound to a bed , than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all.  - Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock.  I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday.  And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it.    Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.

This because alcohol is making the problems go away, just becoming less conscious. The common thing that happens is we trick ourselves into thinking alcohol = less The reality is that there is less of anything. There is less pain, but there is less joy, jealousy, curiosity, on the spectrum of sobriety, stone sober is at one side and unconscious is on the other side.  In other words, the more you drink, the close you move to passing out...which explains why you feel less the more you drink. This seems like not the worst thing in the word. But the problem lies in revisiting sobriety  which is why I call it an if The feelings return and feel stronger than before. This is often what promotes alcoholism. a perpetual escape from returning return of feeling.  This is not to demonize alcohol. Like I said, all about how used. Since, underage, I recommend it. But when you do find yourself drinking one day, try to think about why your drinking. Whenever I have drank because I was sad or angry, I had a miserable time. Whenever I drank because I was around good company and wanted to relax a bit, it was fun. Responsibility is truly key to the concept of alcohol.","an enhancer of mood.

"Life without Joy. I've been dealing with depression for  at least  three years now, with varying levels of severity. There have been some real lows, but I know that's to be expected. What concerns me more than the presence of these lows, however, is the complete absence of highs. In other words, I feel no joy whatsoever. I really don't remember the last time I did.  Despite seeing a counselor regularly, working out 2-3 times each week, meditating daily, and trying out multiple medications, I've seen no improvement in that regard. It takes a lot for me to do all of those things, so it's obviously pretty discouraging that I'm not seeing any results.  Anyone else have this issue?","I feel only bad things, too. I can laugh and joke with my buddies, but it just feels hollow and empty on the inside. I even come to think, that I often times smile and laugh, cause I know a normal person would do this and I did it once, so to don't look like a freak, I do it at the right times.  But I'm never excited these days. I can't even remember the last time I was. Even when I decided to lose my virginity to a prostitute when I was around 30, I had some concerns but I wasn't excited. Birthdays and partys, I knew I couldn't wait for some when I was in my early twenties. Nowadays, I actually have to push myself to go out and meet friends, even though I absolutly KNOW it will be a nice evening.  So, I understand what is up with you. Unfortunatly, I can't give you any advice. : "," normal person would do this and I did it once, so to don't look like a freak, I do it at the right times.  But I'm never excited these days.

One Good Reason.. give me one good reason to not commit suicide today.,"I always think that to myself when I'm feeling suicidal. But there's always something that keeps me going and I just haven't figured it out yet. Maybe because in the end of all of this, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Last night I had an incredibly suicidal episode; I've hurt myself in the past as well. And while I don't know how you feel personally, I can relate. When I feel the way I do, it's really hard to try and see the world around me. Your mom just doesn't understand what you're going through and you need someone that can support you. Hell, even I'll do it and I don't even know you. Sorry if I am ranting, but I do just think that you need to find the right people that can help lift you up. My mother hasn't supported me in any of my depression and anxiety issues at all and it's the loneliest feeling in the world. That's why I turned to Reddit. So if you need support, you can talk to me.

Anyone else feel emotionally numb for most of their lives?. The last time I was truly excited for anything was as a kid. But once I grew out of the Christmas excitement age never really been excited for anything since. It seems like other people get excited when friends or family get married or have kids. Even when my brother got married I feel anything about it. never had anyone really close to me die before but even when my grandparents and great grandparents died I feel sad or anything. I really close but I always thought I should have felt something for them. Same thing when someone gets hurt. I remember when my brother broke his arm when I was a teenager and everyone made a big deal of it and I feel a thing. I worried or scared or anything. I just feel like I have the same emotions as everyone else. Anyone else feel this way?,"I guess you just become a realist?  An example, a family was diagnosed with diabetes and the doctors told her that if she waited for another hour before going to the doctor that she could have died. All the family was worried. But me?

Despair. I wish I had nobody in my life so I feel no remorse for the last stage of my life,"I know what you mean. When I was suicidal the pain I would cause my family was sometimes the only thing that held me back. I tried to think of them as living proof that Depression  personified for metaphor  was wrong about me. It told me nobody cares, nothing matters, if you died nothing would change. I showed it my mother and sister, and told it even if you see no value in me, others do.  Basically, in my mind, I used my family as a logical check against the lies. Depression knows it is irrational; like a con man, it relies on persuasion rather than facts. But even when it takes over all of your other emotions, it can't take control of the emotions of others.","  nobody cares, nothing matters, if you died nothing would change.

Does anyone else feel like they get attached to random people?. I'm just curious because for me I just seem to develop a fondness towards anyone who shows me the slightest kindness. I hardly know them if I know them at all and I'm afraid to actually know them since they'll hate me or I'll drag them down.,"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff  no surprise there  of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs.  Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have  because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am , I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person  they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good . Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it. Thanks for letting me share.","  Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection.

"How is sex even a thing?. And how the hell is it so popular? I can barely speak to people and make friends, and there are probably hundreds of people within a mile of me having sex.","I think I probably spend too much time thinking about sex and stuff and it would probably be better if I didn't. Though I don't think I could enjoy it due to the ever present risk of STI's and unwanted pregnancies and even vasectomies don't technically 100% alleviate that risk. I don't think it would be really all as great as it gets built up in my mind to be.  I think the biggest thing is the difficulty building up and sustaining interest in things to distract myself with. I have things I like, at least theoretically, but I never feel much like persuing them. It all seems kind of meaningless and stupid and pointless. I'm not sure how to get over that hurdle.","  I think the biggest thing is the difficulty building up and sustaining interest in things to distract myself with.

I am feeling very lonely.. My best friend moved to a different country this past year and I had an extreme emotional connection to him. A girl that i had a crush on also left around the same time. I am trying to make friends but I think they really don't like me. I am just feeling so tired of this constant empty feeling inside of my body. I am 16 years old and i just hate school. How should I handle this situation?,"Man I just turned 17 yesterday and I dont think ive had a real life friend since highschool started, so basically I dont think i'll be very helpful but i'd still like to respond. I also dropped out a few weeks ago which I do regret but I just couldnt keep up with the new school I transfered to.  The thing that has been helping me lately, and what my pyschiatrist told me, was to get a hobby. I like to read a lot of japanese books so I picked up on the language so I could start reading them directly from Japan. It's not much of a hobby, reading books and learning a new language, but it gives me something to live for. I want to read a thousand new stories because I love many of the ones I have already read.  I do however think friends are important, although I have none in real life. If anyone at all tries to be your friend, I think you should try and be more open to making friends instead of like me. The last person that tried being friends with me I pushed away a lot and faked most of our friendship, but I regret that since he was willing to put in the effort so I think he deserves to have a good friendship. Don't be fake, people will like you for who you are.","Man I just turned 17 yesterday and I dont think ive had a real life friend since highschool started, so basically I dont think i'll be very helpful but i'd still like to respond.

Can someone who has been through depression describe what it is like to be done with it?. I just want to know what awaits us one day.,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post  or series of them . I joined this subreddit a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey.  To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that.  The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them.  I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.","I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked.   or series of them .

"Yesterday was the worst day of my life, but compared to today, yesterday was good.. This has been my every day for the last years of my life. I needed only one thing to be right in life, so that I could hold on to it.

What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed.  Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.","  What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work.

How did you  If you did  beat depression?. I'm curious to know how y'all did it.,"I watched a short video once  I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car  that compared depression to a big black dog. On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me  rather than constantly for others or other people's approval  really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that. I also drink 0 caffeine but that's mostly due to stomach issues--not sure if that would help or not. Good luck!","I watched a short video once  I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car  that compared depression to a big black dog.

"Self-compassion helped me more than anything. Something that helped to pull me out of my depression and calm my anxiety was learning about self-compassion. No, not self-esteem.

I honestly believe learning self-compassion is one of the biggest steps toward healing.","I agree. This is a good reminder. Thank you. I remember realizing that the way I treated myself was much harsher than I would treat anyone else. The best advice that helped me was to talk to myself as I would talk to a loved friend.

Woke up crying today. I woke up about 4pm crying my eyes out. Last night I tried holding it in as usual but for some reason it came out even tho I thinking about anything at all.,"sorry you feel this way. I have been crying and sleeping for a whole week now, and now I feel worse then ever because I been productive with my free time. Just think about how one day, you will look back on this and wonder why it was ever a problem. This day will come, however long it takes for you to get there. Take your time, blame yourself or punish yourself for feeling this way. This something you have control over and pushing yourself to achieve happiness will only result in a breakdown.

"My boyfriend of 3 years and I just broke up and I feel so lost. My boyfriend and I have just broken up for the second time in our 3 year relationship. He's my best friend and we have been through hell together. I am a mess. I don't know what to do. I am in school right now and I feel no motivation. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't breathe. I went to a counselor today but it didn't help much. I feel so lost, and I dont know what to do. I'm so lonely, my friends haven't been much help. We have mutual friends and I feel like I am losing them. I am so lost. I already have health problems and this is just killing me.","My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this."," The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak.

Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin.

I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped!

I just had the worst interview ever, completely bombing it in the most awkward way possible with the manager probably questioning whether or not I actually got a degree or was just lying by the end of it. Oh, and these interviews come by once every few months if I'm lucky. At this rate I'll have maybe one more before I become homeless.  Now I'm basically just biding my time until I run out of money and have the proper motivation to kill myself. I've given up the fight because I never stood a chance in the first place. How could I? I don't have any special qualities or skills, I'm about the least charismatic person on earth and I'm depressed as fuck. There's not a single reason for the world to care about me.

"First time using anti depressant pills and feel really energized, hyped and my whole body is shaking is this normal?. I use 100 mg Sertalin and I am 17 yo","Yup. In my experience sertraline was more intense than  es citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg.  It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it  and not everyone gets it so powerfully .  If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower  I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up . Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose.  ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep.  It gets a  lot  more boring  but still potentially helpful  once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating  especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term .  So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days  for me, anyway . Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and  ahem  intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.","Yup.

Is anyone else incredibly funny irl but miserable af when they get home?. What kind of jokes do you do? Who knows what you really feel inside? Why do we rely on other people's happiness?,"It's fucking weird.  I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good.  But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression.  I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way.  I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me.  But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood.  I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it.  Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.   Whatever, long story short:  I think I can be really funny, too. Despite the fact I feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all.","It's fucking weird.

I start feeling better than before after 19 days with antidepresants....docter told me it took long to see difference but it started in 3rd week....what it indicate?. Does that mean that medicine will have good and more effect on me?,"everyones brain chemistry is different so it's going to have differing effects at differing times for everyone. The doctor can't really say for sure because science doesn't even really know how or why the drug truly works. It's just a general rule that they have to tell you is to give it at least 6 weeks or so. Not surprising at all that it has made you feel a lot better at 3 weeks, that's when it usually kicks in for me as well. And yes they are designed to build up in your system over time. So it should keep on getting better for 6 months or so  with diminishing increases over time  for it to be at full strength. But again everyone is affected a little differently.

Are there any methods to coping with depression and suicidal thoughts that actually works?. Emotional support does nothing for me yet I see it everywhere. I think many of us need some real help,"Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you.","Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it.

What do you do every day when you're suffering depression?. I really wanna know how other people live their life. I know myself too much but have no clue what depression is like to others.  Thanks.,"I tend to go back to sleep over and over, and I eat at dinner time. spend the nights playing video games and then I oversleep. I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this.  I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better.  I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later.

Have any of you ever ran away from home?. What was your experience like and how did running away affect your depression/behavior?,"I ran away two times as a teenager. One time I was gone for a couple of months. I only went back when I became physically ill and couldn't afford meds. I begged my parents to let me come home and buy my prescriptions. I had a terrible UTI and bladder infection. Going back home was terrible and good at the same time. I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken. Walking to school in the morning, thru classes all day, walking home in the afternoon, having dinner, staring into the void during homework time, staring at the ceiling at night trying to go to sleep, I had a huge pain in my chest and I was alone.", About 80% were completely untrue.

My depression is killing the vibe among my friends. Which is probably why I'm pushing people away...,"Let others suffer with you.  The biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in. It fools us into believing there is no one that will understand. Tells us not to burden others with our problems. Demands we keep our pain in the shadows. But this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness. We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden.  We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others.

"is having an episode a reason to take a few days off?. Its never been as bad as right now, i detest myself. i honestly couldn't see me going to work like that tomorrow. so is that reason enough?",I think that avoiding work to sit at home in your misery is a bad thing. Getting out of the house is recommended even if it's something like going to work. Obviously do whatever you feel is best but I don't think skipping work is going to help you get any better. For example I could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though I'm here hating it I would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day.,I think that avoiding work to sit at home in your misery is a bad thing.

"So the options are either dying in misery or living in misery, either will hurt others and either will be considered ones own fault. You can force someone to stay alive, or to die, but you can't force anyone to truly live, not even yourself. It's kind of an unfair expectation.","It is unfair. Modern psychology/psychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness.  It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide.  As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness.  But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet. I have hope for you and I don't even know you. I want you to wait it out, to battle it out, not because you owe me or anyone else, but because I think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now. What have you tried so far to get some relief? Has anything worked? What can you do that brings you moments of enjoyment?","It is unfair.

Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders.  I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms.  My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt.

"Changing my perception. I read a lot of online forum and article that mental illness is forever,you will need meds forever.I have been diagnosed with schiz,I wonder when will I recover and don't need to obediently take the evil meds with a lot of side effect","I can tell you this much: If you can tell whether or not the medication is making a positive difference, then I'd say that it's worth enduring the negative side effects. As a side note, I feel like I've heard of/known people who eventually weened themselves off of their meds and ended up not needing them, but it's probably different from person to person. I have no idea what the future holds for you, and there's probably no definitive way to predict how things will end up for you and your medication, so good luck.","I can tell you this much: If you can tell whether or not the medication is making a positive difference, then I'd say that it's worth enduring the negative side effects.

Why are you depress?.

I wish I had artistic talent. Art has been my obsession all of my life but i'm so bad at it because i'm an idiot. a cognitively deficient fuck up is what i am,"Nah man, What you're saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art. Most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at  recognizing  good art, but get frustrated because their own art doesn't live up to the crazy high standard they've set for themselves. Malcom Gladwell suggests that it takes 10,000 hours to gain mastery in something. Art is a skill just like anything else. I think a lot of people get fooled into this You either have it or you don't mentality when it comes to creative arts. It's just not the case. I think it's more important that you actually have an obsession and something that you want to be good at! Most people don't have that. Just keep practicing and never give up.

"People who say it gets better don't really know what depression is. I just read yet another it gets better article trying to convince teenagers to not commit suicide. I never tell that lie. I never say it gets better. I say you need to learn how to fight through it. People that think that it gets better do not know what true depression is. They might have had a shitty thing happen to them where they thought for one moment that they didn't want to live any more, but they don't know what it means to live a life of feeling that way. They don't know what it is to lay awake at night, wandering why you can't sleep, and why you are drowning again, when you have been doing so well, only to realize you forgot to take your meds the past couple of days. They will never know what it feels like to accept that this is your life. You will forever be fighting it. You will pray for God to give you peace of mind, and the only way he can give it to you is through a pill that still fails you sometimes.

"Natural remedies for fighting depression/social anxiety?. So, yeah. The title pretty much sums it up. I would like to hear personal stories of success and also failure .","Supplements:  ---  Fish oil: There is some evidence that fish oil with 2 EPA to 1 DHA ratio helps with depression. Helps me a bit but maybe placebo effect.  5-HTP: Tried while really depressed/anxious and it didn't help. SSRIs didn't either and only a long acting Benzo did anything beneficial. Might try again later.  Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me.  Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect.  St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon.  Magnesium: Helps some people  assuming deficiency exists  but I have not tried it yet.  Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home.  Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests.  ---  Lifestyle:  ---  Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though.  Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression.  Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world. Go alone so that you can discover your true self and not be at the whim of another person.

I tend to pretend I am walking inside a crowd of dolls or machines with sleepy consciousness/energy.  I do it all the time because I need to think clearly and   focus  . Staring at moving people with different shapes, clothes and colors distract my focus and disrupt my peace of mind and suck my   energy  . But I like it when people direct their attention to me and stare at me because they subconsciously feed me with their energy and make me feel alive and they loose their vital energy in return which is   s  o sad. I need to stare at the horizon or the sky to focus and to give for the moment a   meaning   that the majority can not see because they are busy talking to others, staring at others, using their phones and giving their consent and   paying attention   and their   time   to others for nothing in return. They have no idea about the importance of these   moving   people and that they are in fact moving vital energies and one must focus to absorb those free energies of life.

"Looking for advice. I have been in a recently. I been to work in 2 weeks and have just been extremely depressed &amp; anxious. I am basically sick of this and ready to make a change but I know where to start. I have major issues opening up to a therapist and have tried numerous times and constantly fail. I am taking meds for the depression and anxiety, but basically think what taking is enough. Does anyone have advice on different coping tactics you use throughout the day to get yourself past the extreme feelings of anxiety? Any other advice on positive or motivational changes I could consider? Willing to try basically anything at this point...","I feel pretty anxious myself. But when i have no choice I just come to the point where i think what's the worse that could happen? maybe I faint. But then there are people to help me.

Having trouble in the subway? Well, you can pull the breaks anytime. That's pretty expensive and affects a lot of people but just knowing that I could is a big plus. I am not a prisoner in these situations. I am free. I can leave whenever I want. But sometimes I realize I panic because of no logical reason. I tell that myself.

Has medical marijuana worked for other peoples depression?. I'm just curious about peoples ideas on the matter.,"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high  and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high  which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed. Would possibly recommend but i think the best idea for those with addictive/binging personalities because you could end up seriously abusing it during massive depressive episodes.","It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse.

"What's the most supportive thing anyone has ever done for you / could ever do for you?. A friend is struggling with depression, and I'd like to help her as much as possible. What can i do to be as helpful and supportive as possible?","I do landscaping during spring through fall. It's just me, not for a company.

How do I deal with study burnout?. These days I just can't seem to concentrate on my studies or even do my assignments. I just have no motivation to do so. I'm slowly getting tired of this routine of endless studying. What should I do to get out of this burnout?,"Maybe you could break the routine somehow, like change your study space? Go to a cafe or the library or stay in your dorm  if you're in college ? That's what I tried to do when I was in a studying slump. I went to a cafe instead and it helped a little bit. You could even treat yourself to something there. That definitely relaxed me. As for a means for motivation, if my depressive symptoms didn't completely take over, what used to drive me during hard times was my end goal, the career I was aiming for. Hope this helps!!","Maybe you could break the routine somehow, like change your study space? Go to a cafe or the library or stay in your dorm  if you're in college ? . Hope this helps!!"
Break even.. Do you think my partner whom broke up with me because of depression is feeling as hurt as I am right now? My former partner seems to be doing very well.,"Because of your depression or your partners?   My ex broke up with me because of hers. At the time she said she still loved me but needed to get better  really true, she was a nutcase . We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.   Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after.","Because of your depression or your partners?

"College graduates/current college students:. How have you gotten through difficult parts of your school year when your depression is severely effecting your academic work? Going through a difficult path this semester and tanked two exams this week already, really looking for some advice to improve.","Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did:  - Get busy studying now  within 15 minutes . No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more.  - After studying go for a run  I don't care if it is 11 pm  or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water.  - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions.  - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people -  added  When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying  instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit .  This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit.

Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying  instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit .  This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit.  This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way."
Cut for the first time in 3 years. I believe I went so long without it. It brought me such instant relief.,this year after a year no incident. it felt so familiar and delicious in a way only those had the habit will know. but its not a good habit. its just not healthy to have open wounds constantly and cutting yourself to handle problems wont help you deal with whats upsetting you. it instead will be a permanent reminder of the pain you feel now. what if instead you used the energy to do something constructive. express yourself. do whatever you Need to do. you Want to cut. you dont need to. you never have. it was just a coping mechanism. you lived without it before and theres no good reason to do it. you dont need to do this. youre not weak or damaged for losing to your emotions and giving into yourself now. but dont lose yourself in the idea that you have to throw all the progress you made away. its been three years and cut yourself once in all those three. thats something to be proud of. sorry this is kinda long but i personally cut for the first time at 11 and it become a habit til 13. i had a relapse myself earlier this year and i know the urge may never go away completely but its something you can control. you can gain greater satisfaction doing something that fulfills you rather than damages you. its just a fact.,this year after a year no incident. it felt so familiar and delicious in a way only those had the habit will know. but its not a good habit. its just not healthy to have open wounds constantly and cutting yourself to handle problems wont help you deal with whats upsetting you. it instead will be a permanent reminder of the pain you feel now. what if instead you used the energy to do something constructive. express yourself. do whatever you Need to do. you Want to cut. you dont need to. you never have. it was just a coping mechanism. you lived without it before and theres no good reason to do it. you dont need to do this. youre not weak or damaged for losing to your emotions and giving into yourself now. but dont lose yourself in the idea that you have to throw all the progress you made away. its been three years and cut yourself once in all those three. thats something to be proud of. sorry this is kinda long but  you can gain greater satisfaction doing something that fulfills you rather than damages you. its just a fact.
I often think about the person I would have been without depression.. So many hobbies and passions that I abandoned.,Me too. I think about this constantly and it gives me a lot of anxiety as well.

Anti-depressants and love/emotions. What's it like for you?,My meds  been on at least 12 different ones over the years  never changed my emotions but usually made me feel that I had the right to feel them and that I could manage them.

With depression I can't do that..it just consumes me, yes this sucks but we are moving past it and can fix it or forget it. With depression I can't do that..it just consumes me

if anti-depressants are so bad then what should one take?. Im passing through a huge crisis right now,"what are you needing help with? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed. There is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds, and monitoring. Lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient, refer a psych and hope for the best.  They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis. Sometimes doctors will prescribe short term assistance like Benzos and tranquilizers to keep stable in the short term, I found this works better for me than long term anti-depressents.","what are you needing help with? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed.

Suicide is not the answer...well.... Then why do more and more people do it? Lmao.,"Simply because it is an answer. When people put definitive statements out there, they are also putting out there it is not the answer for them and for normal society.

It sucks to have someone kill themselves, but there was so much pain and suffering that they couldn't bare it any longer.

Anyone ever feel weird saying you're depressed when you've never been clinically diagnosed. I'm pretty sure I have depression.

"i need to bleed. which area is the most painful yet least dangerous to cut? i can handle physical pain, but i need this emotional anguish to go away.","Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin.

I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.","Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly.

How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep  she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit . Thanks, Charlie.  Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I  literally  sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever.  So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes  five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line . But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late.  In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book  not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever , I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN.  Yes, his name is in all caps . What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener.  More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who  though was just my own voice , talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia.  At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression.  No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.","To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep  she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit . Thanks, Charlie.  Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I  literally  sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever.  So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes  five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line . But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late.  In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book  not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever , I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN.  Yes, his name is in all caps . What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener.  More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who  though was just my own voice , talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia.  At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again.

The loneliness literally hurts. I guess I just long for companionship so much that I feel like I'm in pain I'm so lonely. And my stupid brain won't allow me to go out and meet people because I'm so depressed. Who would want someone like this.... I can't take it.,"This is why communities like this are amazing. We're all at our lowest, and sometimes our worst. We can't judge in the end, at least, I can say so for myself. I feel your pain. Always wanting to be alone with my pain but having it magnified for it. It cuts in a way no knife can reach. I know anytime you post here everyone jumps in with this, but though I suck at human contact my inbox is open if you just want to chat. I'm painfully lonely at times too, and bare minimum we can relate to that.","This is why communities like this are amazing. We're all at our lowest, and sometimes our worst.

I feel like everyone will be better off without my negative energy around them. My depression relapsed after a year and its even worse this time around.,"I was getting better around last November after 2 years of being a shut in. I got a job, moved out and on with my life, and was doing good.  I started to decline about 4 months ago. I'm back to where I was. I moved back. No more job. No more new friends.  The only thing that keeps me going is that this right now won't be forever. It's for now and it's so debilitating. I leave my bed to use the restroom, grab something to eat back in bed, and thats it for last week at my just getting here lowest points.  And over time the time spent like this will get shorter and the time spent on that high curve will go longer and farther. I don't feel that in any way. I'm lucky to have had a decade of therapy to make me feel like I know it tho. Doesn't change the feeling at all but gives me a shred of hope to hang onto.  I'm really sorry you feel that way mate. Some people don't do well with that kinda energy but there are a lot who will not care too and help you with their energy. My dad is neutral and doesn't care, but can't really help. My mother won't even be around me when I'm down. Even told me she can't stand it. Just having the 2 people I have right now for when I am down tho helps me a lot.

My mom and dad both did that to me for a while. I'm 16. I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing.  Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again.  Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think  I know  I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls.  I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.   Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning.

"The dilemma I'm facing every day. Don't be sad and quiet, people don't like sad and quiet.  Don't pretend to be happy and cheerful, people can feel you are pretending, and they don't like disingenuity.","But then it can be even worse.. If we honestly, truly act like we feel 100% of the time, there really isn't much hope to establish any real connection to anyone..

Emotionally abused people. Please tell me your stories if you feel like it. Who abused you? How it affects you? I want to prove myself that my case is not that bad and i can make it.,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes...  I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that.  I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me.  I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently.  I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart.  Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise.  In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture.  I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are.  My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important.  I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody.  My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most.  Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go.  After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all.  I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or  god fobid it  better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed.  I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud.  Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better.  I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling.  Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me.  It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one.  My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always.  I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that.  TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy.  Edit: Added TLDR","I'm game and need to vent so here goes...  I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that.  I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me.  I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently.  I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart.  Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise.  In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture.  I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are.  My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important.  I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody.  My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most.  Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go.  After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all.   My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or  god fobid it  better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed.  I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud.  Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better.  I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling.  Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me.  It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one.

I don't feel important. I feel like I'm marginalized and unimportant. I could disappear and truthfully no one would notice or care. There's nothing about me that's lasting or important about me that comes from me and me alone. I just don't matter.,"It's an interesting thing.

These days, I have a job and i'm in college working on a STEM degree...Still no friends or relationships...not even a sign that anyone is interested.

I don't know what's wrong with me. What should I do?. I don't know why anyone would love me. I don't even like myself. I was having an emotional breakdown about something earlier and my boyfriend tried calming me down. He tried holding/hugging me but I told him to get away from me and said that he doesn't love me and that he's only with me until he finds someone else. He grabbed me and told me that I'm beautiful and that he loves me and that I'm his heart. I continued tried to push him off of me but he just kept holding me tighter. He led me to the bedroom and we laid on the bed and he held me until I fell asleep. When I got up he asked me if I was okay and I told him yes. He asked are you sure and I got annoyed and screamed yes at him.  Why am I the way that I am?,"It's called genetics, I would suggest seeing a doctor, but but why the hell should you listen to me? I resisted getting help till it nearly costed me my life, other people would just rather kill themselves than accept that they have problems so why should I think you're any different?","It's called genetics, I would suggest seeing a doctor, but but why the hell should you listen to me? , other people would just rather kill themselves than accept that they have problems so why should I think you're any different?"
do you avoid making decisions when you're depressed?. Knowing that your ability to make informed and clear decisions may be clouded by your depression. Do you put them off for times that you're feeling not as depressed? Kind of a make hay while the sun shines kind of thinking.,"I do this involuntarily, and it can get bad, fast.  I freeze when it becomes severe; I start running scenarios in my head and I get anxious considering the possibilities. It might be that the outcome in either case is equally good, or I feel underinformed about the possibilities of one case, or what I really know I want to do has a potential worst-case that seems way more likely than it really is because I can't process over my own internal noise, but whatever it is, I just go essentially blank while my brain feels too broken to work it out. If I could undo just this one phenomenon, I could probably live with my depression a lot more easily.    Tl;dr:   right there with ya, OP.","I do this involuntarily, and it can get bad, fast.

My bf told me to cheer up because my life is not that hard. I have never been so close to hitting another person. It made me so angry that he said that to me.,"Dude. This feeling, I know it, and sadly, this is a common go-to response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute. It's out of context and beside the point in essence. It's a variation of the ever popular At least you aren't a starving kid in [insert country here]! and more generally It could be worse! Like, yes, thanks very much Captain Obvious, everything is relative, but that's beside the point?

My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said.  In any case, I'm sorry you had that shitty non-reason response thrown at you. What you're going through is real and valid, even if others choose not to acknowledge it.","Dude.

"I can't figure out what's going on right now...am I just unlucky?. So I've been dealing with terrible apathy and overall lack of interest with things such as school lately. I don't know if my medicines are working but it's been really difficult to get out of bed and make it to class lately. It's reached a point wherein it becomes so overcoming that I feel so powerless. I have little to no focus when it comes to schoolwork.  To add to that, I injured myself recently and it requires surgery.

"wish I were dead : . About 19 years ago, I tried to kill myself by swallowing 31 extra strength sleeping pills - and I had an amazing spiritual experience.

"Has anyone here gotten better and stayed better?. As far as I've been able to tell, no matter if you get better or not, depression will always just come back. Temporary problem, my ass.","This stuff all exists on a spectrum, so maybe arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems. I've had hardcore depression for many years, but I have definitely moved the bar significantly  without meds and without getting what i want in life or something, like a great relationship  which I can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly, but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity. I see depression  speaking only for myself here  as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with  even arbitrarily . So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues. Meditation is the single most powerful tool i've found."," arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems.

one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly.  The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones.  If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness.  There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.","That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand.

It was like I had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so I cant do academics.  I am different but I'd rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things I can't. I can do something better then they can, know how to go through hard times and keep pushing.  When life gets hard for them they will break, and I won't be there to help them.  Don't worry about other people, they will become dust while you will become a diamond. My question to you is, how are you going to move forward?"
"I Have Friends, But They Always Care More About Others. like that one guy everybody calls when available. It sucks and feels bad, cause when I call one of them they give a shit.","I can relate. Been a third wheel in many friendships, always feels like I'm someone people hang around instead of hang with.  I even had a friend invite me over and told me he called everyone else first, but nobody was free, so guess it was time to call me. I know he didn't mean it that way, but what a shitty thing to say. Everyone else more important than you was busy, so you  bottom of the list  will have to do.  It hurts and depression makes it hurt x100. Gotta find a way to prove to yourself that you are worth spending time with. I'm struggling with this pretty badly too so I wish you the best.","I can relate.

"If I get caught will I end up in a psych ward?. I'm planning on killing myself and was wondering if i somehow survived,would i get put in a psych ward for the rest of my life?","Depends what you mean by get caught. Someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if you're under 18 parents can take you to a hospital. Basic detainment is 72 hours  3 days  To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. Reddit isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers. Also get help.","Depends what you mean by get caught.

"How do you handle people that pray on your depression/anxiety?. Sadly, I have friends that pray on my depression/anxiety. There's always something to disagree with or some snide comment to make. How do you guys cope with this? It makes me really anxious, which just leads to anger.","Here is the thing. If you open up to these people and they through it in your face right after, then you know they aren't real friends. A real friend is willing to sit through peoples problems for hours. I once sat and chatted with a friend about his issues for some 7 odd hours hours just talking till 7am, never gave up on the conversation, he did the same for me a while later down the road when I was having problems. People who aren't willing to talk to you and help you aren't worth keeping around. Believe me there is a friend out there who is willing to listen. I guess do keep in mind that not everyone has infinite patients and has their own problems. good luck out there man hope things go well for you.   This isn't to say you can't have acquaintances, people you hang out with, but never get deep ","Here is the thing.

I'm to scared to commit suicide.. All I can feel is pain. Nothing matters to me anymore and life is a miserable struggle. I don't want to live anymore but I can't bring my self to commit suicide. I'm scared of missing out on a potentially better life. Please help,"I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself.","I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing.

"26 year old male, living at home, low income job, in school  parents paying for it , want to get married to girlfriend who graduates with nursing degree in 5 months. I feel like a deadbeat","I see what you mean, but imagine being 26, living at home with no job, absolutely no way to pay for school, and no girlfriend?  I'm 26 with a decent job and live alone with no girlfriend. I tell myself that it's because I don't have a license due to a seizure disorder that I'm striking out with girls, which is probably true is some cases but I can't even see that girl being in one relationship for the rest of her life if she's picky like that.",", but imagine being 26, living at home with no job, absolutely no way to pay for school, and no girlfriend?
