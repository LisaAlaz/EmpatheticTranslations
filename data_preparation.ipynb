              "0  I've had a hard time going back to school. Going back to school has been difficult for me, It's been around five years since I've been in a class room and I ask the teachers and the people that I go to my classes to cut me some slack for being rusty but they tell me that it doesn't matter, and my step mom doesn't want me to use the computer because she doesn't want to share. Its lead me to skipping classes because I feel like theirs no use in going to school, it would be cool to know how you would handle this situation and if you can give me any advice.  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too  \n",

What is the point?? Everything is shit anyway?? I really didn't ask to be born and then my parents put this life responsibility on me. Anybody else feel like this?  ...  omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that  child labor laws, yo .
